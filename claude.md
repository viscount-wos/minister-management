## Important Business Logic

### Point Calculation System

Located in: `backend/database.py` → `calculate_points()` function

**Monday (Construction Day):**
```python
points = (construction_speedups_days * 1440) + (general_speedups_days * 1440)
         + (refined_fire_crystals * 30000) + (fire_crystals * 2000)
```

**Tuesday (Research Day):**
```python
points = (research_speedups_days * 1440) + (general_speedups_days * 1440)
         + (fire_crystal_shards * 1000)
```

**Thursday (Troop Training Day):**
```python
points = troop_training_speedups_days  # 1 point per day
```

Note: 1 day = 1440 minutes

### Auto-Assignment Algorithm

Located in: `backend/app.py` → `/api/admin/assignments/auto-assign`

1. Calculates points for all players for the selected day
2. Sorts players by points (descending)
3. Generates 30-minute time slots (00:00, 00:30, 01:00, etc.)
4. Matches player hourly preferences to 30-min slots
5. Assigns highest-point players first to their preferred slots
6. Tracks unassigned players

### Database Schema

**players:**
- `id`, `fid` (unique player identifier, REQUIRED)
- `game_name`
- Speedups: `construction_speedups_days`, `research_speedups_days`, `troop_training_speedups_days`, `general_speedups_days`
- Resources: `fire_crystals`, `refined_fire_crystals`, `fire_crystal_shards`
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

**time_preferences:**
- `id`, `player_id`, `time_slot`
- One row per time slot preference

**assignments:**
- `id`, `player_id`, `day`, `time_slot`, `position`, `is_assigned`
- Stores final ministry assignments per day

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Player ID (FID) is Required
- Players MUST provide their own FID
- No auto-generation
- Used for updating submissions
- Validation enforced on both frontend and backend

### 2. Time Slot Granularity
- Players select preferences in 1-hour increments (00:00 to 23:00)
- System assigns in 30-minute increments (00:00, 00:30, etc.)
- Each hourly preference covers two 30-minute slots

### 3. Multi-Language Support
- 5 languages: English, Korean, Chinese, Turkish, Arabic
- RTL support for Arabic
- All UI text in `frontend/src/i18n.ts`
- Language state managed via react-i18next

### 4. Authentication
- Simple password-based auth for admin/minister
- Two passwords (same permissions): ADMIN_PASSWORD, MINISTER_PASSWORD
- Tokens stored in localStorage
- Not production-grade security - meant for trusted users

## Environment Variables

Located in: `.env` (created from `.env.example`)

Required variables:
```env
FLASK_ENV=development|production
SECRET_KEY=flask-secret-key
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin-password
MINISTER_PASSWORD=minister-password
DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/minister.db
PORT=8080
```

## Running Locally

### Quick Start
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# Runs on http://localhost:8080

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### With Docker
```bash
docker compose up --build
# Runs on http://localhost:8080
```

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
- `POST /api/player/submit` - Submit/update player info
- `GET /api/player/<fid>` - Get player by FID
- `GET /health` - Health check

### Admin Endpoints (require Authorization header)
- `POST /api/admin/login` - Authenticate
- `GET /api/admin/players` - Get all players with calculated points
- `PUT /api/admin/player/<id>` - Update player
- `DELETE /api/admin/player/<id>` - Delete player
- `POST /api/admin/assignments/auto-assign` - Run auto-assignment
- `GET /api/admin/assignments/<day>` - Get assignments for day
- `POST /api/admin/assignments/update` - Save manual assignments
- `GET /api/admin/export/<day>` - Export Excel file

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Language
1. Edit `frontend/src/i18n.ts`
2. Add new language code to resources
3. Add translation keys matching existing structure
4. Update `languages` array in `LanguageSelector.tsx`

### Modifying Point Calculation
1. Edit `backend/database.py` → `calculate_points()` function
2. Update documentation in README.md and USER_GUIDE.md
3. No database migration needed (calculated on-the-fly)

### Adding New Resource Types
1. Add column to players table in `backend/database.py` → `init_db()`
2. Add to form in `frontend/src/pages/PlayerForm.tsx`
3. Update point calculation if needed
4. Add translations to `frontend/src/i18n.ts`

### Changing Time Slot Granularity
1. Frontend input: `PlayerForm.tsx` → `timeSlots` array
2. Backend assignment: `app.py` → `/api/admin/assignments/auto-assign`
3. Admin display: `AssignmentManagement.tsx` → `generateTimeSlots()`

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Submit player with all fields
- [ ] Submit player without FID (should fail)
- [ ] Update existing player via FID
- [ ] Admin login with correct password
- [ ] Admin login with wrong password (should fail)
- [ ] View all players in admin table
- [ ] Sort players by different columns
- [ ] Edit player information
- [ ] Delete player
- [ ] Auto-assign for Monday
- [ ] Auto-assign for Tuesday
- [ ] Auto-assign for Thursday
- [ ] Drag-drop player between time slots
- [ ] Export to Excel
- [ ] Switch languages
- [ ] Test Arabic RTL layout

### Edge Cases to Consider
- Player with no time preferences
- Player with 0 points
- Multiple players wanting same time slot
- Very large numbers of speedups
- Empty database state
- Browser refresh during form submission

## Known Limitations

1. **Authentication**: Simple password-based, not production-grade
2. **SQLite Limitations**: Not ideal for high concurrency; use single gunicorn worker
3. **No Email Notifications**: Players must manually check assignments
4. **Single State Only**: No multi-state/multi-organization support
5. **No Audit Log**: Changes aren't tracked historically
6. **Browser Storage**: Admin tokens in localStorage (not secure for production)

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. Backend changes: Flask auto-reloads in development mode
2. Frontend changes: Vite hot-reloads automatically
3. Database changes: Delete `data/minister.db` to recreate schema
4. Translation changes: Edit `i18n.ts`, Vite hot-reloads

### Before Committing
- Update relevant documentation (.md files)
- Test both English and one RTL language (Arabic)
- Verify both admin and player flows
- Check mobile responsiveness

### Deploying to Cloud Run
See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for full instructions covering bare metal, Docker, Cloud Run, and other platforms.

## Deployment Lessons Learned (Cloud Run + GCS FUSE)

These were discovered during production deployment and are critical knowledge:

### GCS FUSE Requires journal_mode=DELETE
SQLite WAL mode creates `-shm` and `-wal` sidecar files. GCS FUSE cannot handle out-of-order writes to these files, producing `BufferedWriteHandler.OutOfOrderError`. The fix is `PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE` (set in `database.py` → `init_db()`). If you see this error, delete the database from the GCS bucket and let it recreate.

### Cloud Run Needs min-instances=1
Without `--min-instances 1`, Cloud Run aggressively scales to zero. On cold start, the container crash-loops (starts, runs ~90 seconds, gets SIGTERM, restarts). This produces 429 "Rate Exceeded" errors for users. Setting min-instances=1 keeps one warm instance and prevents this.

### Single Gunicorn Worker for SQLite
Multiple gunicorn workers cause concurrent SQLite writes. On GCS FUSE this produces `OutOfOrderError` on journal files. On local filesystems it can cause database lock errors. The Dockerfile uses `--workers 1 --threads 2` which is safe.

### Cloud Run gen2 Required
GCS FUSE volume mounts require `--execution-environment gen2`. Gen1 does not support volume mounts.

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Check `.env` file exists and has DATABASE_PATH
- Verify virtual environment is activated
- Check port 8080 is not in use: `lsof -i :8080`

### Frontend won't start
- Clear npm cache if permission errors
- Check node version (need 18+)
- Port 5173 conflict: change in `vite.config.ts`

### Database errors
- Path doesn't exist: Check DATABASE_PATH in .env
- Permission denied: Ensure write access to data directory
- Locked database: Close other connections

### Drag-drop not working
- Check @dnd-kit packages installed
- Verify browser JavaScript enabled
- Check console for errors

## File Conventions

### Code Style
- **Backend**: Python PEP 8, 4-space indentation
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, 2-space indentation, functional components
- **CSS**: Tailwind utility classes, avoid custom CSS

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerForm.tsx`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `handleSubmit()`)
- **API routes**: kebab-case (e.g., `/api/admin/auto-assign`)
- **Database**: snake_case (e.g., `construction_speedups_days`)

### File Organization
- Pages: Top-level routes (`pages/`)
- Components: Reusable UI (`components/`)
- Admin-specific: In `components/admin/`
- Types: Inline in TypeScript files
- Translations: Centralized in `i18n.ts`

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **This application is designed for trusted users within a game state**
