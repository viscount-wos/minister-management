# Ministry Management System - User Guide

## Overview

This application streamlines the process of assigning ministry positions during State vs State (SVS) events in Whiteout Survival based on player resources and time preferences.

## For Players

### Application Closing Time

Your minister may set a deadline for new applications. The home page displays the status:
- **Green text** - Applications are open (shows when they close)
- **Red text** - "Applications closed" (new submissions are no longer accepted)

After the deadline, the "Submit New Application" card is grayed out and the form shows an "Applications closed" message. However, **existing players can still update** their submissions using their FID. The status auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

### Submitting Your Application

1. **Navigate to the home page**
2. **Click "Submit New Application"** (only available while applications are open)
3. **Step 1: Enter Your Information**
   - Player ID/FID (required - this is your unique identifier, you'll need it to update later)
   - Click **"Load from WOS"** to auto-fill your game name, avatar, and furnace level from the WOS API
   - Game Name (required - auto-filled if you use Load from WOS, but editable)
   - Alliance Tag (required, 3 characters max - displayed as `[TAG]` next to your name)
   - All your speedups in days
   - Your fire crystals, refined fire crystals, and shards (fire crystal fields may be hidden depending on admin settings)
   - **Note:** If you try to leave the form with unsaved changes, you will be asked to confirm

4. **Step 2: Select Time Preferences**
   - Select all times (UTC) when you're available
   - **Select ALL times you could possibly be available** - more slots means a better chance of being assigned
   - Time slots are color-coded with a **heat map**: blue = low demand, yellow = medium, red = high demand. Choosing less popular times improves your chances.
   - Click any time to select/deselect

5. **Step 3: Review and Confirm**
   - Double-check all information (including your avatar preview and alliance tag)
   - Click "Submit" when ready

6. **Success!**
   - Your application has been submitted
   - Remember your Player ID (FID) - you'll need it to update your submission later

### Understanding Your Assignment

- Assigned times may be **+/- 20 minutes** from the hour you selected. For example, if you selected 14:00, your actual slot could be 13:40-14:20.

## Tips

### For Players
- **Be honest** about your resources
- **Select ALL available time slots** to increase chances of assignment - the more flexible you are, the better
- **Use the heat map** to see which times are less competitive
- **Update regularly** if your resources change
- **Note your FID** so you can update later
- **Check the Player Guide** (`/guide`) for detailed instructions
- **Remember the +/- 20 minute tolerance** - your actual slot may differ slightly from the hour you selected

### For Ministers
- **Configure Settings first** - set your state number, closing time, and research day before collecting submissions
- **Set an application closing time** to enforce a deadline for new submissions
- **Run auto-assign first** to get the optimal initial assignment
- **Lock key players** before re-running auto-assign to preserve important assignments
- **Make manual adjustments** as needed for special circumstances
- **Publish schedules per day** when assignments are finalized
- **Export players to JSON** before making major changes (as a backup)
- **Export to Excel** before finalizing for record-keeping
- **Check unassigned players** and try to accommodate them manually
- **Check the Admin Guide** (`/admin/guide`) for detailed instructions

## Troubleshooting
