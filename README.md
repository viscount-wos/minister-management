## Quick Start

### Option A: Docker Compose (easiest)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your passwords
docker compose up --build
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

### Option B: Local Development (bare metal)

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Create .env with DATABASE_PATH=./data/minister.db
python app.py
# Backend runs on http://localhost:8080
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend (hot reload):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173 (proxies API to :8080)
```

### Option C: Production Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for Docker, Google Cloud Run, and other platform instructions.
